# the-eighth-run

Game submission entry for GitHub Game-OFF 2023

Music themed runner game with power-ups, milestones and retro aesthetic
You are in control of a note, escape the hordes of musical notes coming at you and earn exciting powerups on the way.

## Setup 🔧

Download the repository, in it open a terminal screen and type
`python setup.py build`

This will create a build directory where you can find the executable. I am also working on creating installers in the future. (I just need PCs running different OS because cx_Freeze cannot cross compile 🥲)

If you simply want to try the game, you can also directly run the `main.py` file.
Note that these require the `pygame` module and its dependencies.

- [x] Powerups
